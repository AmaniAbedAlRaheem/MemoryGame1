## Game Logic ❓

The memory game is game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. Have Fun ! 😉
